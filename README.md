friendly is an AMD ui library.
------------------------------
c8 is an acronym for friendly.

Inspired by the elegance of twitter/bootstrap, with the AMD goodness of dojo. 

I wanted more flexibility and to use a smaller subset of bootstrap. I wanted to also make usage of code and the corresponding css to be modular. 

Non-dojo dependencies:

x-style

Current issues:
